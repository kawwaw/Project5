        <h3>Number of Crimes by Day of the Week</h3>
        <p>
            The visualisation on the right-hand side shows a radial plot displaying the distribution of crimes across the days of the week.
        </p>
        <p>
            Originally, the hypothesis was that perhaps more crimes occur on certain days of the week such as Friday and Saturday when more people
            are likely to spend their spare time out in the streets. However, the visualisation proves that this is not the case as the number of crimes
            that are reported on any particular day of the week is very similar to the other days.
        </p>
        <p>
            The plot shows that the values for each day are very similar. By hovering over a specific bar in the plot, the actual number of crimes recorded
            on that day of the week is displayed.
