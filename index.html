                In this project we investigate the variance of 40 different hands in different configurations. The hands vary in size, shape
                and configuration. For each hand we have x and y coordinates of 56 specific points of the hand outline. This
                gives us 112 values for each hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                To investigate the variation between the hands outline a principal component analysis (PCA) was made. This statistical methods
                place 40 hands in a 112-dimensional space. This means that all the variables have a dimension orthogonal
                to all of the others. The 40 points lay as a cloud of points in this multidimensional space, and the analysis
                finds the direction in the space that represents the largest part of the variance between the 40 points.
                This direction is called the first principal component (PC1). Next the second direction is found orthogonal
                to PC1 and describing the largest part of the rest of the variance.

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
            The PCA gives us some remarkable results that we have listed here:
            <ul>
                <li>As there are only 40 hands in the 112-dimensional space, the first 40 PC´s can capture the entire variation.</li>
                <li>
                    The first 5-6 PC´s captures almost all variation. The scatterplot view shows that if you change the PC´s shown. For PC´s
                    number 7 and later the points almost have the same values and the variation is very low.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The hand outlines on top of each other illustrates that PC1 represent the variation of how spread the fingers are and also
                    the position of the start and end points of the hand outlines.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            We can conclude that the PCA is able to find the most important variance between the hands and this variance is easy to interpret
            visually. Interactive visualization is a great tool to illustrate results of high dimensional data and the analysis
            of these.

            Implementation of 'Support changing which two PCA-variables are displayed in panel two'
        </p>
        <p>
            The user can now choose from two dropdowns which PCA-variables they wish to be displayed. When a value is selected, the scatter
            plot will transition the points into the new position.
        </p>
        <p>
            This feature makes it easy for the user to observe the changes in variance between individual PCA-variables. It is clear from the plot
            that combinations of the first few variables result in the points being fairly spread out while the use of variables with smaller variance
            brings all the points closer to 0 on both axes.

        <p>
            My individual part is the section with the blue hand outline. My intension was to show what PC1 really captures of variation.
            By sorting of the hands and placing them one by one on top of each other the user should be able to follow the
            trip from one end of the PC1 to the other. By coloring the hands according to their order number along PC1 it
            makes it easy to see the changing outline pattern. Improvements: An idea is to make the hand outlines smaller
            and move the whole svg as a little train along the PC1-axis that could also be visualized.

            I have implemented the 'Display multiple hand-outlines and highlight the corresponding PCA-coordinates when one is selected'
            suggestion from the assignment description.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the user clicks a point in the scatter plot, the hand corresponding to the point will be display in the hand-outline
            section. The user can click multiple points in the scatter plot, to display multiple hands. Each click generates
            a random color for the point and hand-outline pair, used to indicate which points has been clicked, and to illustrate
            which hand-outlines each point represents. The user can toggle the hand-outline, by clicking the point again.
